        </div>
        <p>We chose to proceed with the standard button model and a togglebox preview as we believe the benefits of these designs outweigh their downsides. In the case of the toggle box, it’s biggest weakness as compared to a checkbox is that it requires more work to be intuitive to a real world counterpart. However, it benefits from it’s minimalist design, easy identifiability, and lack of strict commitment. The checkbox on the other hand carries an implication of more permanent selections and implies some meditation is required before confirmation. These are all very small divergences, but we believe they are important when deciding our final creation. It seems that in this instance, the justification given by Saadia Minhus in they’re article Checkbox vs Toggle Switch, where they state that “User needs to perform instantaneous actions that do not need a review or confirmation”, which fits closest with the functionality of Piazza’s post preview.</p>

        </div>
        <p>This design combines the filter and cogwheel into one button. This is because previously, the filters were splayer above the search bar, which lowered the signal to noise ratio of the system. They also were already contained within the cogwheel menu, which further adds to the redundancy of the previous design. We believe the name of the button adaquetly communicated where the old filters have gone, which is supported by Nick Babich’s article Best Practices for Search, where they state that “if you do hide some, add a link to “View All Filters” so that they’re still accessible.” It also updates the cogwheel to fall more in line with it’s function: that being options related to Filtering and Posts.</p>

        </div>
        <p>In our mockup for this design we decided to maintain the view of the resolved/unresolved view for students, while increasing the opacity of the coloration of the original wireframe. In addition we changed the filled circle to be greyed out, a low contrast color that will reduce the chances of users mistaking it for an interactable element. Additionally, according to Nadeeka Athukorala’s article How To Not Get In Trouble When Branding Your App With Red, “when the other elements are too in red, it just creates a competition among all the elements, making the user unable to focus on the most important message.” To help alleviate this we lightened the color of the resolved/unresolved icon so that it was less harsh for both professors and students, and made sure that the resolved state was a clear complimentary color, notably the same shade as the primary color of piazza’s branding. These gives the element a seamless look as well as communicating confirmation for the different state.</p>

        <h3>STORY: As a student, I want to be able to show and hide the sidebar so I have more room to read posts.</h3>
        <div class="figma">
          <iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F6SNr7H03ERQUTc42AA1hKq%2FMockup-Sidebar-Collapse-Button"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>We chose this design because it emphasizes a previously hard to spot element in the Piazza interface. Screen space, especially for mobile users like laptops and phones, is incredibly important for usability. So promoting the use of the feed collapse button helps increase usability throughout Piazza and overwhelmingly increases it for the stakeholders out team is most concerned with, that is new users and time constrained users. This design not only improves on the original design by having increased contrast with the frame, more noticeably interactable elements, and larger overall presentation, but it beats out our other design in many ways. Since this change accomplishes several things at once, I believe it may be better to list off the benefits of the design over the previous.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> The button maintains it’s position despite the changes around it, which out previous design failed to do. “Nevermind the choice of icon or its position, whenever an accordion is expanded, it should be easy to immediately collapse it. This interaction shouldn’t require any extra movement of the mouse cursor or finger...” (Friedman)</li>
          <li>The proximity and visual similarity to the New Post button helps users categorize it easier as a button in their conceptual model as supported by the proximity principle. “The principle of proximity states that items close together are likely to be perceived as part of the same group — sharing similar functionality or traits.” (Harley)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In our mockup we decided to add another layer of interaction that is the change in appearance on a click, which causes the button to take on the appearance of a pressed button using an inner shadow. This helps “draw attention to certain elements by making them pop and help create a unique look” (3), which accomplishes our goal of promoting interactivity and customizability of the Piazza UI.</p>
        <p>Additionally giving it a high contrasting color similar to the “New Post” button helps communicate interactability “A contrasting color from the surrounding text and background”, as is stated by the Health.gov’s article Make Clickable Elements Recognizable.</p>

        <h3>STORY: As a student I want to toggle the Note History on and off so that I have more screen space to use if I don't use that feature.</h3>
        <div class="figma">
          <iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FYIn0cUyU8VDfSgCnU54Pfw%2FMockup-Note-History"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>We ultimately decided that this design was superior for a few reasons. First and most obvious, the positioning of the option turn off/on the Note History function being in the Settings menu most closely follows the the proximity principle. This is defined in Aurora Harley’s article Proximity Principle in Visual Design as “The principle of proximity states that items close together are likely to be perceived as part of the same group — sharing similar functionality or traits.” This creates an intuitive spot for the setting. The biggest downside we initally suspected in this decision is that legacy users may be confused by the now vanished Note History function. However, given it’s niched function and the few steps required to re-enable it, we believe the increased screen space as well as the increased signal to noise ratio will be a marked improvement.</p>
        <p>Another aspect that we believed beat out the opposing design is that the setting is hidden in the menu, rather than left in view. Leaving it in view may not have improved the design, as the space would still be left somewhat busy with the added toggleable element.</p>

        <h3>STORY: As a student I want to be able to close the donation message so that I can view more of a post at one time.</h3>
        <div class="figma">
          <iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FsIg5VuewYyt2RHhYT8FDFi%2FMockup-Donate-Close"></iframe>

        <p>We chose to proceed with this design as it follows several principles that the first idea did not. Firstly, this design takes advantage of the principle of proximity. By placing and designing the button similarly to the donation buttons, it signifies that it affords being pressed and that it belongs to the group of buttons associated with the donation box. Additionally, by placing it on the bottom of the donation box it is slightly closer than the previous design, which improves it “Because elements separated by whitespace are perceived as being less related, far-away items can be easily overlooked by task-focused users who expect all relevant information and interactive elements to be placed close together” (Harley). It also follows the natural direction a users eyes will follow when scanning the post, moving from the top and down to the post they want to read, so having the post and “close” button nearby affords the user to spot it quicker and more intuitively then the top right hand corner.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the nature of a “close” button carries less baggage then an “X” button in UI design. In Aurora Harley’s article Cancel vs Close: Design to Distinguish the Difference, they state that “Yes, the X icon is commonly recognized by users to mean either to cancel or to close, but distinguishing between the two possibilities is critical for the success of the interaction.” This points to the X button being a UI element that a lot of users have common interactions with and likely place a lot of importance in. To foster a sense of user confidences, we opted for a design with less finality, so that users will feel enabled to experiment with the new elements we’ve added, especially given that the donate box returns after changing posts only a few times.</p>
