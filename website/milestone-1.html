        As a platform, Piazza has excellent affordances but it can be difficult to use. Too much information is presented at once leading to information overload, and interactive elements are difficult to find and in unintuitive places. These and many more problems make it extremely difficult to navigate piazza in real time when used in class. Students are unable to keep up with the instructor and face-to-face instructional quality can be dimished.

        The effect of piazza's many clashing elements causes repeated instances of "Norman Door" like effects whereby the user makes mistakes and sacrifices their work flow, time, and mental energy in order to use the platform. In any one instance, this would negligible impact, but the combination of these poor UI decisions across the entirety of the platform makes piazza negatively impacts the user experience. A great example of this is the overall lack of clarity on what is and is not a button or hyperlink within the UI elements of Piazza, specifically the "Post" button not clearly having many of the common UI standards that user often expect in a traditional button layout.

        The stakeholders of piazza in regards to our theme of face-to-face instruction include students, professors, and teacher's assistants. Though these stakeholders may be impacted in various ways, a smoother workflow and reduced mental overhead leads both to more in-class and out-of-class participation. Because of this, our experience with piazza feels like more of a chore than a useful tool for facilitating meaningful discussion. This problem especially impacts students, especially when Piazza is used as a tool for in-class activities, because it can prevent students from having a smooth and meaningful learning environment.

        The problems with Piazza’s interface are apparent in and out of the classroom, and from a purely UI/UX focused perspective fixing the problems we’ve identified would be equally helpful in both use-cases. In the classroom however, the ability to easily and quickly interact with Piazza is crucial to students keeping up and staying engaged. Adding and adjusting certain features would further improve the classroom-specific experience, but this is out of the scope of the course.
